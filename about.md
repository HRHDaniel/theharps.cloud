## Me
I am a software engineering director with experience in technology, finance, and healthcare industries. I love leading teams and leveraging technology to solve problems or make our lives better.

## This blog
My appetite for learning and technology keeps me constantly tinkering with home projects, including several related to home automation. We have come to appreciate several of these projects on a daily basis. I have made a fair number of mistakes along the way as well, leading to failures resulting in rebuilding some of these projects multiple times. This blog serves as a form of personal documentation to save from repeating the same mistakes and to leverage in rebuilding or updating these projects as needed. I decided to post it publicly in blog form hoping it can be useful to others as well.
